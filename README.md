1.data_types

Function that takes one argument,
Compares and return results, based on the argument supplied to the function.
e.g
For strings, return its length.
For None return string 'no value'
For booleans return the boolean
For integers return a string showing how it compares to hundred e.g. For 67 return 'less than 100' for 4034 return 'more than 100' or equal to 100 as the case may be
For lists return the 3rd item, or None if it doesn't exist
